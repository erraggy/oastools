            Use the gopls-mcp server to to leverage:
            1. Workspace Analysis - go_workspace gives me the module structure and layout
            2. Real-time Diagnostics - go_diagnostics shows build errors and issues
            3. Package API Discovery - go_package_api provides comprehensive type information
            4. File Context - go_file_context shows intra-package dependencies
            5. Symbol Search - go_search helps locate types, functions, and variables
            6. Reference Tracking - go_symbol_references shows where symbols are used
            
            Proactively use gopls-mcp when:
            - Analyzing Go code changes or PRs
            - Investigating bugs or issues
            - Planning refactoring work
            - Understanding codebases
            - Validating that changes don't break builds
            - Exploring package dependencies
            
            Be constructive and helpful in your feedback.
